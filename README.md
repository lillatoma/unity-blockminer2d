## Project background
I started learning Game development in Unity in July 2021, and after I finished small projects while being guided, I wanted to make a project with Unity as a challenge. This is the result. With this project I further pushed my understanding of how colliders and triggers work, became more familiar with the user interface of Unity and learned that instantiation is not necessarily the best way to create objects.
